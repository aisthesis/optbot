Database: "Options"

Tables:
    tblTransactions
        key
        combinationId (ref to tblCombinations)
        OptType (int referring to table with 'call' and 'put')
        Strike (float)
        Expiry
        SharePrice
        TotalPrice
        nShares (nContracts?)
        Closes (int for transId, -1 or None for opening transactions)
        Open (? bool. Derivable from Closes after search)

        Notes:
        Commission can be calculated from SharePrice, TotalPrice
        and nShares

        All transactions should be viewed as buys (thus saving a table
        and making calculations easier). A sell is just a negated buy.

    tblOptTypes
        key
        Type ('call', 'put', 'eq'?)

        Notes:
        Including 'eq' has the advantage that covered calls can
        be included in transactions. But it has the disadvantage
        the trading the equity is structurally somewhat different.

        Is buying the equity the same as buying a call with strike 0
        and exp infinity? The only difference I see is dividends.

    tblCombinations
        key
        Date

    tblDividends (?)
        key
        Date
        combinationId
        Amount

How would this look in MongoDB?
